### Hi there, I'm Gareth! ðŸ‘‹
I have been tinkering with web sites for a long time and have been making websites for over 15 years. Recently I have been getting more serious about developing
interesting and useful web apps and programs. I love solving problems and using IT and the web to come up with exciting solutions.

I started developing for the web back when Geocities was all the rage and everyone had a Yahoo! or Lycos email address. Now, I'm into NodeJS, React and Python in the Cloud and I've some experience working with Azure to deploy app services and other resources. To add some extra specialist sugar, I am CompTIA A+ and Google IT Support Specialist certified - giving me that extra resource to help with those software, hardware and networking issues.
